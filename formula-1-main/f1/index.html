                    <p>Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton was born on 7 January 1985 in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England. It was clear from very early on that he had a natural talent for racing. In 1998, Ron Dennis signed him to the McLaren's Young Driver Programme. He broke down racial barriers as a junior kart racer and he remains the sport's only black driver. One thing he always remember is what his father Anthony told him: “Always do your talking on the track". And he has done that. He's one of the greatest drivers of F1 history, holding several records.</p>
